# PWC Data Analytics Remote Internship
## Monitoring Call Centre Trends
### Scenario
For this assignment I was tasked with developing a dashboard for the call centre manager at "PhoneNow", a telecom client, to present her with the call centre trends.<br> <br>
The following metrics were included in the analysis: <br>
* Overall customer satisfaction <br>
* Overall calls answered/abandoned <br>
* Calls by time <br>
* Average speed of answer <br> <br>

### Key Insights from the dashboard
* There is a **0.23%** increase in the number of calls answered and a **1.12%** in the number of queries resolved as compared to the previous month which shows an improvment in agent performance.
* The overall issue resolution rate of **89.94%** is quite satisfactory. Further steps can be taken in training agents on their communication skills to further improve this metric.
* From all of the answered calls around **81%** are answered. This can occur if agents spend a long time on each call, fewer calls can be answered within a given period. Consequently addiional agents can be hired so that a larger volume of incoming customer queries are handled in a timely manner.
* Although the issue resolution rate is high, the overall (average) customer satisfaction is still somewhat low i.e **3.4**. This could suggest that while most customer issues are being resolved, the manner in which they are resolved or other aspects of the customer experience may not be meeting customer expectations. Also, while issues are being resolved, they may be taking longer durations than expected, leading to customer frustration. Thus it is suggested that additional resources should be spent in agent training and awareness.
* **"Technical Support"**, **"Payment Issues"** and **"Streaming"** are the 3 most common themse appearing within the incoming calls in near equal volumes.
