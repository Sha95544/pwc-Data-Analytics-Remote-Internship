# PWC Data Analytics Remote Internship
## Monitoring Call Centre Trends
### Scenario
For this assignment I was tasked with developing a dashboard for the call centre manager at "PhoneNow", a telecom client, to present her with the call centre trends.<br> <br>
The following metrics were included in the analysis: <br>
* Overall customer satisfaction <br>
* Overall calls answered/abandoned <br>
* Calls by time <br>
* Average speed of answer <br> <br>

### Key Insights from the dashboard
* There is a **0.23%** increase in the number of calls answered and a **1.12%** in the number of queries resolved as compared to the previous month which shows an improvment in agent performance.
* The overall issue resolution rate of **89.94%** is quite satisfactory. Further steps can be taken in training agents on their communication skills to further improve this metric.
* From all of the answered calls around **81%** are answered. This can occur if agents spend a long time on each call, fewer calls can be answered within a given period. Consequently addiional agents can be hired so that a larger volume of incoming customer queries are handled in a timely manner.
